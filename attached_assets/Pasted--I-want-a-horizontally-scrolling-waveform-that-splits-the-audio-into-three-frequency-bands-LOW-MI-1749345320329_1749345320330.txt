“I want a horizontally scrolling waveform that splits the audio into three frequency bands — LOW, MID, HIGH — and draws each as a colored band (like stacked lanes) moving over time. It should resemble Pioneer CDJ-3000’s overview waveform, using flat bars or strips that change in length and color intensity to reflect amplitude and transient energy in each band.”

🧱 Technical Breakdown

1. Horizontal Layout
	•	Time flows left to right.
	•	Center marker shows the current playback position.
	•	Background grid lines indicate beats or bars (based on BPM).

2. Frequency Split
	•	The waveform is split into 3 bands:
	•	LOW: Sub and bass (e.g., 20–250 Hz)
	•	MID: Mids (e.g., 250 Hz–4 kHz)
	•	HIGH: Treble (e.g., 4 kHz–20 kHz)

Each band is rendered as a horizontal strip (like a frequency lane):
	•	LOW = bottom strip
	•	MID = middle strip
	•	HIGH = top strip

3. Color Coding
	•	Each band uses a distinct color or tone (can be static or dynamic based on energy).
	•	Common: LOW = green, MID = yellow/orange, HIGH = red/blue
	•	On CDJs, it’s usually neon-style colors on black.

4. Amplitude/Intensity Visualization
	•	Each bar or rectangle in the band lane varies in height or intensity based on the band’s amplitude at that point in time.
	•	Visually appears like vertical ticks in each band lane.
	•	Update interval: ~30–60 fps or every X ms (depending on playback speed and UI framerate).

5. Grid Overlay
	•	Optional grid lines represent:
	•	Beat subdivisions (e.g., every ¼ or ½ bar)
	•	Cue points
	•	Beat grid markers synced to BPM

🛠️ Development Implementation Notes

Audio Analysis:
	•	Use Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or FFT to extract frequency content.
	•	Group frequency bins into 3 bands.
	•	Calculate RMS energy or peak within each band every X ms.

Rendering:
	•	Use a canvas or WebGL engine.
	•	Render 3 separate horizontal lanes.
	•	Draw vertical bars whose height or opacity is based on band energy.
	•	Add scroll or position pointer synced to track progress.
