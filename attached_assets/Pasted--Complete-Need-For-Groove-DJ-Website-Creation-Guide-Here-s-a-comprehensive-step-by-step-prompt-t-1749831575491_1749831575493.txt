🎧 Complete Need For Groove DJ Website Creation Guide
Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step prompt to recreate this entire professional DJ website from scratch:

🎯 Project Overview
Create a futuristic, terminal-style DJ website called "Need For Groove" - a professional platform for a NYC-based electronic music duo specializing in House and Techno. The site should feel like a retro computer operating system with modern functionality, featuring a complete content management system, music library, and interactive DJ equipment interface.
